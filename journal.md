Sorry, I didn't know I still had to complete the journal because I was doing different assignments. Nevertheless a recap of what I did the last two weeks, I created an account on Ear Sketch to code beats because I want to become a audio engineer and create my own music when I become an adult. My first beat was named "take1" because that's precisely what is was, I was testing the waters to see if I wanted to do this all year, didn't have any inspiration behind it I just let my thoughts flow. For my second beat I wanted to create a chill/lofi beat so I spent 3 days surfing the different options composing what I felt would place someone in a calm mindset while they do work or just sitting around, I was liked the way it came out it was much better than I thought it would be. The next week I found a melody that felt somewhat inspirational so I wanted to build a beat around that specific melody the word that came to my mind was "Triumph" so I composed it with that in my mind and after hours of trial and error I finally had something I felt was good enough to say I was finished with it and again I was very proud of what I had accomplished definitely my favorite out of the 3.

This is a free week.

In coding following instructions to the T is very important because if you mess up at a certain step whether it's mispelling or completely messing up, it will cause the whole program to break and not work at all. For example, when I'm coding my beats and I'm trying to set the effects for the track if I type seteffect instead of setEffect it will cause the program to completely misunderstand what I was trying to say. This shows that even a capital letter at the wrong spot can ruin everything, following instructions especially in coding is incredibly important if you want the code to do what it's intended.

I use computer science indirectly on a day to day basis, whether that's playing on my playstation, watching a tv show, or even listening to music. It's all apart of a program made to satisfy our needs, but on the other side things like the internet or credit and debit cards are also computer science, it allows us to have a easier lifestyle day by day. Computer Science impacts me in many various ways and are probably being used even more in my life and I just don't know it yet. Without Computer Science life would be drastically harder and more boring because our information and ease of access would be reduced significantly but also most of our entertainment would be taken away.

The career job I researched is audio engineering for music. The responsibilities of an audio engineer is to capture, mix, or reproduce sound using electronic audio equipment mainly for music. To become an audio engineer you need to usually possess a bachelor's degree, master's degree or higher qualification in acoustics, physics, computer science or another form of engineering. With experience and enough skill you could have clients who are famous rappers like metro booming or work the audio in prestiigious plays and many more. I believe in God and I believe he's called me to make music and learning to be an audio engineer would be very helpful on my path.

Why can knowing how to code improve our problem solving skills, it's a simple answer because it's incredibally difficult thing to learn and to well do. A small mistake can throw off the whole code and it can take a very long time to figure out where your mistake is but when you break it down and go through it slowly. You unconciouslly figure out how to effectively problem solve. Understanding how to code can increase your mental fortitude in a sense because it'll make challenging tasks seem easier because you're so used to challenging code, so jobs that have finance or or healthcare you won't be stressed as easily because you've built a tolerance in a sense. But coding can also enhance your creativity by bringing your ideas to life, it opens up possibilities that couldn't be imagined before because now you have the skills to do it. Even if you're not pursuing a career in computer science or coding it's good to learn a little because it can improve all aspects of your life.

AI is very important to today's society because it makes our day to day life more effiecient, convinent, and easier. For example using the gps to tell you where the best route is and how to avoid traffic are all able because of AI's and makes our lives for one much easier. But on the other side unemployment is rising because many jobs are being taken away because of these Ai's. For example, we no longer need people on the phone when we're calling the bank because they have Ai's to do that for us. While this may seem good at first we need to also realize that many can't make a living because we're giving their jobs to a machine.

A positive impact new technology has on the election process is that it makes the entire process more effiecient. Now that you can vote with machines there's less likely gonna be miscounts or it being rigged because it's all automated, along with this it's more efficient process getting you in and out and back to your daily life. But a negative impact is, it's still possible for it to be hacked and rigged from an outside source. Someone who is very smart and has the means to do so could completely shut down the election and no one could do anything about it.

It's important to protect your data and personal information, especially when technology can easily take and use this information, to protect yourself whether that be from attacks like swatting or someone taking your identity and stealing who you are. To ensure you're always protecting your identity you have to make sure that if you must share information don't give to much and only give what's needed, never share passwords to cards or social security, and you have to be smart is who you're giving this to a trustworthy organization or just some random person. I have accidentally shared some things that were too personal and I regret it, it wasn't something that can make or break my life but it was something that they didn't need to know all you can do is live on and be better in the future. To balance working on projects and protecting your privacy all you have to do is what I said before, give only what's needed and if what's needed could compromise your safety don't give it at all.

An event or thing that interest me is watching basketball. My team is the Dallas Mavericks and they added Klay Thompson to their roster this year, considerably boosting our offense but at sacrafice of our defense because we lost two good defenders. Now statistically speaking the Mavs should be at the top of the league because of the new play style they have and how it fits incredibly with their team. But we're losing games..why? Because of injuries and under performances from our role players. Now even though the data says we should be destroying the league the real life situations completely change the analysis. Technology could play a role in addressing this event by creating a product that can allow star players and role players to be able to play at their best but reduces injuries to a minimum. Now they have moved towards this by a ton in the last 20 years, for example if we had then what we have now players like Paul George or D Rose would have a less chance of being injured. But again life happens and even though we have the technology sometimes there's nothing you can do to stop the problem.

Technology has allowed humanity to become more effiecient in the way we produce our food but also how we can effectively and quickly grow our food. Vertical Farming is a groundbreaking find in science because it allows crops to be grown effieciently but also because it allows us to growq our crops without using an abundance of materials. Another great addition to our lifestyle is automation that we have because of technology which boost our production a thousand fold, while these are amazing and important in our day to day life there are some downsides to this. One rampant one is the ongoing laziness society is conforming to because of these delivery apps people are starting to rely on others more than themselves which seems convient in the short term but in the long run it can be detrimental for the human race. Now there is nothing wrong with using technology to improve our life but when we start to overly rely on technology we subconsiously start to be more lazy brings which is terrible for our future.

I researched the production of humanoid AI robots and they are being produced and tested in Norway to try to create robots to help people around the house. But they are also releasing robots into stadiums and arenas to see if other people would notice them or just see them as humans. Me personally I believe this is dangerous, experimenting with AI humanoid robots and believe nothing good can come out of this. I prefer if the people around the world would take a step back from this project because as we've seen in the movies, things could go wrong in a split of a second. 

# December 9th, 2024

To me the term brain rot is a annoying trend going around the internet currently, using combination of words that doesn't make sense to try to make a joke. Social Media has had both positive and negative impact on my mental health this year. Somethings I see like basketball or good christian content and music bring me joy. But on the other side there are many terrible things being posted onto social media that only sow negativety but I've had more of a positive than negative impact from social media this year. Some new words and trends I really enjoy but a lot of times I feel society tries to force us to like or hate something even if our personal feelings go against it. Technology can impact you both positive and negatively but it's only what you allow to.

Yes I'm excited to get my much needed rest.

# January 8th, 2025

I enjoyed the personal project it was cool to do something new, even though it was stressing me out. I don't really have anything specific I would like to work on, just trying different things to see what I would do in my future. And I have no certifications I would like to pursue as a future in this subject.

# January 13th, 2025

I don't like the shift society is taking into a Ai dominated era. I believe it's dangerous and harmful for humanity, it will in my opinion, reduce job opportunities and limit jobs significantly by making Ai control most of it. Now Ai does have some features that are very beneficial and great for humanity like the gps but others like ChatGPT or extreme automation in services will be harmful in the long run, as well as the deep fake technology being rapidly improved in society will eventually make us doubt everything because we don't know what it actually real. For me in this job changing society I'm going to branch off and do my own thing and pursue music, I'm gonna succeed or die trying.

Government intervention on technology can have both a positive and negative impact on society. A positive being if its something that harms the society like adult websites, shutting them down would be beneficial for society but it can also have a negative impact if they remove something or change something that doesn't harm society as a whole. Tiktok needs to figure out a way or prevent the leaking of information while using their website in order for something like this to not happen again in the future. If Tiktok doesn't address this now the government might intervene again to put out another ban in order to protect our information. To increase user privacy a feature I would add would put some type of incryption to make it significantly harder for people to steal data to protect users data privacy. Another feature I would add is some type of vpn already incrypted into the app again to try to stop the stealing of data all together. A lesson I can take away from this situation is the importance of protecting the users data because if you slack on it or straight up ignore it, it can be not only harmful for the users but also harmful for the company and in the worst situation shut it down.

I feel like the most important thing the aviation needs right now is uninterruptable communication with everyone in that sky area. The reason in my opinion that both crashes occured was because of a miscommunication between both fliers. If we can create some type of technology that can provide clear uninterruptable communication I feel accidents like these will be significantly reduced. Alongside this we need active observations of the coding that goes on in the aircrafts and outside of the aircrafts. There is error in computers even in a perfected program but I feel if we have a group of people constantly observing and fixing errors as they occur again accidents will be significantly reduced. All in all, uninterruptable communication paired with constant human observation will improve aircraft safety. I don't think it's a technological advancement problem I feel it's because we aren't advancing what we have to make it improved to the max before we try to "upgrade" it.
