Sorry, I didn't know I still had to complete the journal because I was doing different assignments. Nevertheless a recap of what I did the last two weeks, I created an account on Ear Sketch to code beats because I want to become a audio engineer and create my own music when I become an adult. My first beat was named "take1" because that's precisely what is was, I was testing the waters to see if I wanted to do this all year, didn't have any inspiration behind it I just let my thoughts flow. For my second beat I wanted to create a chill/lofi beat so I spent 3 days surfing the different options composing what I felt would place someone in a calm mindset while they do work or just sitting around, I was liked the way it came out it was much better than I thought it would be. The next week I found a melody that felt somewhat inspirational so I wanted to build a beat around that specific melody the word that came to my mind was "Triumph" so I composed it with that in my mind and after hours of trial and error I finally had something I felt was good enough to say I was finished with it and again I was very proud of what I had accomplished definitely my favorite out of the 3.

This is a free week.

In coding following instructions to the T is very important because if you mess up at a certain step whether it's mispelling or completely messing up, it will cause the whole program to break and not work at all. For example, when I'm coding my beats and I'm trying to set the effects for the track if I type seteffect instead of setEffect it will cause the program to completely misunderstand what I was trying to say. This shows that even a capital letter at the wrong spot can ruin everything, following instructions especially in coding is incredibly important if you want the code to do what it's intended.

I use computer science indirectly on a day to day basis, whether that's playing on my playstation, watching a tv show, or even listening to music. It's all apart of a program made to satisfy our needs, but on the other side things like the internet or credit and debit cards are also computer science, it allows us to have a easier lifestyle day by day. Computer Science impacts me in many various ways and are probably being used even more in my life and I just don't know it yet. Without Computer Science life would be drastically harder and more boring because our information and ease of access would be reduced significantly but also most of our entertainment would be taken away.

The career job I researched is audio engineering for music. The responsibilities of an audio engineer is to capture, mix, or reproduce sound using electronic audio equipment mainly for music. To become an audio engineer you need to usually possess a bachelor's degree, master's degree or higher qualification in acoustics, physics, computer science or another form of engineering. With experience and enough skill you could have clients who are famous rappers like metro booming or work the audio in prestiigious plays and many more. I believe in God and I believe he's called me to make music and learning to be an audio engineer would be very helpful on my path.

Why can knowing how to code improve our problem solving skills, it's a simple answer because it's incredibally difficult thing to learn and to well do. A small mistake can throw off the whole code and it can take a very long time to figure out where your mistake is but when you break it down and go through it slowly. You unconciouslly figure out how to effectively problem solve. Understanding how to code can increase your mental fortitude in a sense because it'll make challenging tasks seem easier because you're so used to challenging code, so jobs that have finance or or healthcare you won't be stressed as easily because you've built a tolerance in a sense. But coding can also enhance your creativity by bringing your ideas to life, it opens up possibilities that couldn't be imagined before because now you have the skills to do it. Even if you're not pursuing a career in computer science or coding it's good to learn a little because it can improve all aspects of your life.

AI is very important to today's society because it makes our day to day life more effiecient, convinent, and easier. For example using the gps to tell you where the best route is and how to avoid traffic are all able because of AI's and makes our lives for one much easier. But on the other side unemployment is rising because many jobs are being taken away because of these Ai's. For example, we no longer need people on the phone when we're calling the bank because they have Ai's to do that for us. While this may seem good at first we need to also realize that many can't make a living because we're giving their jobs to a machine.

A positive impact new technology has on the election process is that it makes the entire process more effiecient. Now that you can vote with machines there's less likely gonna be miscounts or it being rigged because it's all automated, along with this it's more efficient process getting you in and out and back to your daily life. But a negative impact is, it's still possible for it to be hacked and rigged from an outside source. Someone who is very smart and has the means to do so could completely shut down the election and no one could do anything about it.

It's important to protect your data and personal information, especially when technology can easily take and use this information, to protect yourself whether that be from attacks like swatting or someone taking your identity and stealing who you are. To ensure you're always protecting your identity you have to make sure that if you must share information don't give to much and only give what's needed, never share passwords to cards or social security, and you have to be smart is who you're giving this to a trustworthy organization or just some random person. I have accidentally shared some things that were too personal and I regret it, it wasn't something that can make or break my life but it was something that they didn't need to know all you can do is live on and be better in the future. To balance working on projects and protecting your privacy all you have to do is what I said before, give only what's needed and if what's needed could compromise your safety don't give it at all.

An event or thing that interest me is watching basketball. My team is the Dallas Mavericks and they added Klay Thompson to their roster this year, considerably boosting our offense but at sacrafice of our defense because we lost two good defenders. Now statistically speaking the Mavs should be at the top of the league because of the new play style they have and how it fits incredibly with their team. But we're losing games..why? Because of injuries and under performances from our role players. Now even though the data says we should be destroying the league the real life situations completely change the analysis. Technology could play a role in addressing this event by creating a product that can allow star players and role players to be able to play at their best but reduces injuries to a minimum. Now they have moved towards this by a ton in the last 20 years, for example if we had then what we have now players like Paul George or D Rose would have a less chance of being injured. But again life happens and even though we have the technology sometimes there's nothing you can do to stop the problem.
