Sorry, I didn't know I still had to complete the journal because I was doing different assignments. Nevertheless a recap of what I did the last two weeks, I created an account on Ear Sketch to code beats because I want to become a audio engineer and create my own music when I become an adult. My first beat was named "take1" because that's precisely what is was, I was testing the waters to see if I wanted to do this all year, didn't have any inspiration behind it I just let my thoughts flow. For my second beat I wanted to create a chill/lofi beat so I spent 3 days surfing the different options composing what I felt would place someone in a calm mindset while they do work or just sitting around, I was liked the way it came out it was much better than I thought it would be. The next week I found a melody that felt somewhat inspirational so I wanted to build a beat around that specific melody the word that came to my mind was "Triumph" so I composed it with that in my mind and after hours of trial and error I finally had something I felt was good enough to say I was finished with it and again I was very proud of what I had accomplished definitely my favorite out of the 3.

In coding following instructions to the T is very important because if you mess up at a certain step whether it's mispelling or completely messing up, it will cause the whole program to break and not work at all. For example, when I'm coding my beats and I'm trying to set the effects for the track if I type seteffect instead of setEffect it will cause the program to completely misunderstand what I was trying to say. This shows that even a capital letter at the wrong spot can ruin everything, following instructions especially in coding is incredibly important if you want the code to do what it's intended.

I use computer science indirectly on a day to day basis, whether that's playing on my playstation, watching a tv show, or even listening to music. It's all apart of a program made to satisfy our needs, but on the other side things like the internet or credit and debit cards are also computer science, it allows us to have a easier lifestyle day by day. Computer Science impacts me in many various ways and are probably being used even more in my life and I just don't know it yet. Without Computer Science life would be drastically harder and more boring because our information and ease of access would be reduced significantly but also most of our entertainment would be taken away.
